  <div id="post"><p>I released an open source RSS reader — <a href="https://github.com/swanson/stringer">Stringer</a> — a few 
months ago and it has enjoyed a fair amount of popularity. It is a bit
tough to measure usage (GitHub doesn’t track number of clones, self-
hosted with no mechanism to “phone home”) but it is approaching 2000
stars on GitHub and has at least <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/07/10/post-google-reader-subscriber-stats">1300 installs</a>.</p>

<p>This is my first project on GitHub to really blow up; I had mild
success (~50 star range) for a landing page app I built a while ago,
but Stringer has far exceeded that.</p>

<p>This post recounts my observations about getting traction for Stringer
— results may vary but I think this is pretty sound and very 
actionable advice.</p>

<p>There is definitely luck involved but I want to talk about a great
concept from Jason Roberts: <a href="http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">luck surface area</a>. The amount of
luck you have is proportional with the number of people you have
communicated your something to.</p>

<p>Here are some deliberate steps I took to increase my luck surface area
for Stringer:</p>

<h1 id="timing">Timing</h1>

<p>The Google Reader shutdown had been announced. Like most people I was
a little bummed out, but it was far enough in the future that I didn’t 
give finding an alternative much thought.</p>

<p>By March, I was starting to get bothered by the “Google Reader is 
shutting down” popups and decided to look for other options.</p>

<p>When I released Stringer it was near the beginning of the “hey I wrote
an RSS reader” wave that was picking up steam. There was a bit of first
mover advantage here, if I could build something compelling to a user
they wouldn’t have to write their own or go with one of the other
options.</p>

<p>The timing was also important for “freshness” — Stringer was not
the only self-hosted RSS reader out there. <a href="http://www.feedafever.com/">Fever</a> and <a href="http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki">Tiny-Tiny RSS</a> were
both popular, but they both looked dated and unmaintained. In 
comparison, Stringer was new and in active development.</p>

<h1 id="screenshots-screenshots-screenshots">Screenshots, screenshots, screenshots…</h1>

<p>I’m not going to lie: design is huge for this kind of project. Design
is huge for every open source project, it just takes different forms.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests">Requests</a> doesn’t need pretty screenshots, but it needs to convey the
well-designed API with clear examples at the top of the README.</p>

<p>An app <strong>must</strong> have screenshots — or some kind of demo mode.</p>

<p>Go look at a bunch of “Show HN” posts and you will almost always see a 
comment along the lines of “I’m not going to register just to see what
your app looks like, please add a screenshot”.</p>

<p>And they are right! Are you really going to clone my git repo, install
a bunch of gems and setup a database to find out what the thing looks
like? Of course not. I wouldn’t and I can’t imagine who would.</p>

<p>Stringer has three big screenshots, all specifically picked to show a
different part of the app. An instruction page that shows you use the
thing, an Inception-like shot of someone reading a post about Stringer
while using Stringer, and a final shot showing the feed management 
page.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.github.com/swanson/stringer/raw/master/screenshots/instructions.png" alt="Stringer Screenshot" style="max-width:600px;" /></p>

<p>Compare the <a href="https://github.com/swanson/stringer/blob/master/README.md">README</a> of Stringer to some competitors: <a href="https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/blob/master/README.md">CommaFeed</a> 
<a href="https://github.com/SSilence/selfoss">selfoss</a> <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur">NewsBlur</a>. You can tell if Stringer is going to be the right choice for you right away.</p>

<h1 id="marketing---its-all-about-the-snowball">Marketing - it’s all about the Snowball</h1>

<p>I don’t have a large Twitter following. At the time of this writing I
have 375 followers. When I first tweeted about Stringer I had closer
to 275.</p>

<p>I had local connections from the Indy.RB meetup group so I got a few
retweets from that, but by and large I didn’t make a huge ripple.</p>

<p>I sent a tweet with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#replacereader</code> hashtag, something that I came
across when looking for alternatives. Again, nothing big here.</p>

<p>And lastly, I sent a <a href="https://twitter.com/_swanson/status/330344830364434432">tweet</a> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">@TheChangelog</code> — the 
only blog about open source that I really knew of.</p>

<p>I posted a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5650606">ShowHN</a> (19 pts - got autoflagged because I direct 
linked to it on Twitter, don’t do that) and posted it to /r/programming
and /r/ruby (+188 and +76 respectively).</p>

<p>And then it was time for the Snowball Effect to kick in.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">@TheChangelog</code> (6k followers) <a href="http://thechangelog.com/stringer-a-self-hosted-anti-social-rss-reader/">tweeted it</a> and put it on their blog 
(I was so pumped!). The reddit and HN Twitter bots started sending it 
out, there are a few accounts with a couple thousand followers that
just tweet the top stories.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">@ruby_news</code> (14k) picked it up from /r/ruby and it was later in Peter
Cooper’s Ruby Weekly newsletter (10k+ readers, %55 open rate).</p>

<p>From there other blogs and people on Twitter start picking it up
and pretty soon you are at 1000 stars. Now you are a trending repo on
GitHub and are showing up at the top of GitHub searches for “rss
reader”!</p>

<p>I made sure to respond to any questions on Twitter and to post a link
to Stringer in a few comment threads on HN about RSS readers (but not
every one, don’t come off as spammy).</p>

<p>Stringer got picked up by <a href="http://onethingwell.org/post/49859167693/swanson">OneThingWell</a> and started getting some 
attention from the designer space. I started getting tweets from
users that had it up and running and were telling their friends.</p>

<p>Luck plays a huge part, but just telling people about what 
you made really improves your luck.</p>

<h1 id="personalityvision">Personality/Vision</h1>

<p>Early on, I gave the project a distinct product vision. Stringer is an
anti-social RSS reader. I took an opinionated stance on the direction
I wanted to take and made it very clear from the get-go. Maybe you will
lose some potential users that feel alienated, but for a smaller group
your project will really resonate and they will help you promote it.</p>

<p>It is the same line of thinking that has become popular in product
development. Build something that a small group loves instead of a
bland one-size-fits-all app with 37 features.</p>

<p>Having a strong tagline also gives people good tweet-fodder ;-)</p>

<p>I felt really awful having to reject pull requests that didn’t fit the
vision of the project, but at the end of the day Stringer is better for
it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Was it lucky that <a href="https://github.com/swanson/stringer">Stringer</a> got so popular? Absolutely.</p>

<p>But I increased my luck surface area substantially with good timing,
plenty of screenshots, telling people, and giving it some
personality.</p>
