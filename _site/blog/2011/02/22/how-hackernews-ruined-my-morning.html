  <div id="post"><p>Derek Sivers once wrote that <a href="http://sivers.org/multiply">“ideas are just a multiplier of execution”</a>. 
It makes perfect sense – the observation that execution is more important than the idea is one of those 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">why-didn't-I-think-of-that-and-write-a-book-about-it</code> concepts that seems to be echoed by all of the 
software entrepreneur pundits. But until today it didn’t really sink in.</p>

<p>I was bummed out to see a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2249390">post on HackerNews</a> today for 
a web app that recommended and categorized technical books.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But that sounds like something useful and cool! Why are you bummed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, because it is the same idea as a <a href="http://bibliotechnical.com/">side project</a> I have been working 
on for the past month. And worse, I counted at least five other commenters coming out of the woodwork with 
their own in-progress versions.</p>

<p>This has become par for the course with the ubiquity of the internet these 
days; you have a flash of inspiration, only to find out 2 minutes (and a Google search) later that six people 
already wrote the same library, there are three apps that offer the same functionality already or that a 
better way already exists that you didn’t even consider.</p>

<p>The sting is even worse when you have invested time and resources already. The idea may be “worthless”, but 
it sure doesn’t seem 
that way when its YOUR idea.</p>

<p>A few hours (and a pity party) later, I realized that this isn’t the end of the world.  The concept has been validated; 
the fact it was popular on HackerNews (the target audience) and that other programmers were working on similar sites means 
that there was a need for improvement in this area.  I also have over 100 comments of feedback that I can use and apply 
to my own site.</p>

<p>And most importantly, I think that my execution is better. Obviously I am biased, but most of the improvements brought up
in the comments are already addressed by my project.</p>

<p>In 
<em><a href="http://mdswanson.com/writeup/2010/10/28/getting-real.html">Getting Real</a></em>, I learned that having a rival 
or <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Have_an_Enemy.php">enemy</a> can help you hone in on the
problems you are trying to solve. In addition to Amazon book reviews and the perennial AskReddit/HackerNews book threads, I
now have several direct competitors.</p>

<p>It is energizing and I hope it will push me to improve <a href="http://bibliotechnical.com/">bibliotechnical</a> and grow as a developer.</p>
