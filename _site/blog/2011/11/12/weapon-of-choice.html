    Weapon of Choice

  </p>

  <div id="post"><p>One thing I love about writing my own little side-projects and one-off programs is that I
can constantly try out new ‘weapons’ for developing software. And once I get a feel for something
I like, I can practice and train myself to become more effective with it.</p>

<p>When I’ve gone to battle lately, here’s what I’ve been bringing:</p>

<p>##Language: <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>
If you told me two years ago that I would reach for Ruby as my go-to language, I wouldn’t have
believed you. I was pretty into Python - the language I was learning when I first fell in love
with programming - and Ruby was a little weird (I still find some Ruby syntax inferior
to Python).</p>

<p>But I like <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem</code> more than <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code>, I like Rails more than Django, and Sinatra is close enough to 
Flask that I don’t notice.</p>

<p>I still bust out Python for one-off scripts, but if I’m starting a web project these days, it’s
going to be in Ruby.</p>

<p>There are no heavy IDEs required, no 30 lines of boilerplate and no complicated process to get
my program running. There is a vibrant community of developers (both locally and across the 
web) making gems, writing posts, and creating learning materials that make Ruby a joy to 
work with.</p>

<p>##Datastore: <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>
Let’s put aside the arguments of scalability, ACID, reliability, etc etc.</p>

<p>I like MongoDB because it gels with how I think. I really like the concept of a document store
and Mongo’s ad-hoc queries can do everything I need. But most importantly, no setting up a rigid
schema and defining a bunch of tables. There’s a time and place for a rock-solid SQL setup with
migrations, foreign keys, and a heavy-duty ORM - but not for most of my projects.</p>

<p>##Platform: <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>
I don’t think this needs much explaining - Heroku is just awesome. Git-based deployment, tons of
easy to use addons (MongoHQ, Cron, and SendGrid are my personal favorites), and everything Just
Works. I recently spent some time setting up nginx, Unicorn, and Capistrano for a project and it
made me appreciate how simple and elegant Heroku is even more. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/devops_borat">DevOps</a> is just not my
thing.</p>

<p>##Frontend: <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> + <a href="https://github.com/necolas/css3-github-buttons">css3-github-buttons</a>
Bootstrap is a piece of drop-in magic that gives me the power to make things not look awful. The 
grid system is easy to use, the default fonts look good, and the form elements are really slick.</p>

<p>The css3-github-buttons project is a set of commonly-used buttons and icons. All I have to do 
is add <code class="highlighter-rouge">class="button icon search"</code> to a link to transform it into a rounded button with a subtle
gradient and magnifying glass glyph icon.</p>

<p>I don’t have the artistic ability to be a designer, but I know what looks good and what doesn’t.
My projects without Bootstrap don’t look good, and my projects with Bootstrap do.</p>

<hr />

<p>My Weapons of Choice share some common traits; I look for something that is fast and 
straightforward to get started with, flexible, expressive, and, most importantly, readable.</p>

<p>I spent like an hour on wikipedia looking through this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_weapons">List of Weapons</a> to try to find 
one that matched these traits and I ended up picking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C5%8D">Bō</a>.</p>

<p>Yup, it’s a wooden stick - that’s how I roll.</p>
