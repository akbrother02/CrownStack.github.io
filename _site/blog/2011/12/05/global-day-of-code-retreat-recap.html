    Global Day of Code Retreat Recap

  <div id="post"><p>Over the weekend, I took part in the Indy edition of the <a href="http://blog.coderetreat.com/global-day-of-coderetreat">Global Day of Code Retreat</a>.</p>

<p>I had never been to a Code Retreat before and didn’t really know what to expect.</p>

<p>The gist of a Code Retreat is to take some time to practice writing code and applying techniques 
that you aren’t normally able to use in your day job - usually due to schedule or budget pressure. 
This practice is facilitated by Pair Programming in small sessions. The idea is to work on solving
a problem (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>) for 45 minutes, then delete your code, rotate pairs, and
start again.</p>

<p>Each pairing rotation also has a unique set of constraints that encourages you to think outside
the box and explore new ways to solve the same problem.</p>

<p>There is plenty of extra information about Code Retreats available elsewhere, so I thought it might 
be valuable to recap what I actually did during the pairing sessions.</p>

<p>#Pair One
My first pairing of the day was with Jon, who was a self-described “procedural guy”. He worked on
writing installers in his day job so he was interested in doing more OOP stuff.</p>

<p>We decided to use Ruby and RSpec for our development environment - mainly because I wanted to try it
out and Jon was willing to indulge me.</p>

<p>We spent most of the time getting familiar with the problem domain and applying the Four Rules of the
Universe to a Cell class. I introduced Jon to Ping Pong pairing, which was a concept that I was 
introduced to by an <a href="http://spraints.github.com/">old coworker</a> and we ended up getting all of our tests passing. We
were about to move on to start modeling the Board when time was up.</p>

<p>#Pair Two
I was able to find someone else that wanted to use Ruby, so I paired with a guy named Shawn next. 
The challenge for this round was to try to use polymorphism instead of primitive-types (e.g. use
an enum of states instead of a boolean flag).</p>

<p>Shawn wanted to explore an idea that would have a Cell generate it’s own neighbors on the Board
when the game first started. We came up with a neat concept for navigating to neighbors using
a Hash with keys like <code class="highlighter-rouge">:left</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">:right</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">:up</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">:down</code> - then we could combine two directions
to find a Cells upper-left neighbor for example.</p>

<p>We struggled to find a good way to detect if a given Cell needed to be generated or if it had
already been generated by another Cell. We were making some progress, but then time expired.</p>

<p>#Pair Three
After we rotated, I was paired with Daniel, a .NET developer that I knew from Indy ALT.NET. Our
constraint for this round of pairing was to focus on how we would deal with the “infinite-nature”
of the Game of Life. It is rather simple to model the game as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">N x N</code> array, but what happens 
when N becomes larger than can fit in memory.</p>

<p>Daniel and I spent a bit of time brainstorming an idea based around circular buffers. The idea was
to keep only a finite chunk of the universe in memory at a time and partition the rest of the data
into ‘stripes’ that could be stored to disk. It was described as a cylinder with other tangent 
cylinders in 3D space- yeah, sounds pretty weird but made sense at the time…</p>

<p>We used C# this time and when time expired we were in the middle of debugging why the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Blinker</code> shape
wasn’t working.</p>

<p>#Pair Four (after lunch break)
I stayed in .NET land and paired with Mike, another familiar face from ALT.NET. We had talked about
doing an event-driven model over lunch so we decided to try to implement it. The challenge for this
iteration was to do Ping Pong pairing - since I had been doing this all along, nothing really changed
for me.</p>

<p>The event-driven model was a pretty neat concept. Instead of trying to manage a global Board state, 
we would use a message bus and cells would subscribe to it. Each cell would filter out messages
that weren’t relevant and broadcast messages about itself (“I’m alive”, “I’m dying”, etc).</p>

<p>Using a test-driven approach allowed us to define the public “messaging API” quickly and we were
able to spot problems almost immediately. We ran into a few cases of getting stuck on stuff
outside the problem domain so we were just getting into the meat of the message bus when time
ran out.</p>

<p>#Pair Five
Back to RSpec and Ruby as I paired with Vamshi. Vamshi took a different approach that any of my
other pair partners. When I immediately went to start writing the first test, he stopped me and
we discussed the overall design we wanted for 2-3 minutes.</p>

<p>I think this was helpful because, at this point in the day, I was kind of an auto-pilot for the
first 15 minutes of the pairings. First we make the Cell class, then we add the tests for the rules,
then we add the Board class with a list of Cells…</p>

<p>By stopping and re-approaching the problem from a different angle, my preconceived ideas were
put aside. In our design, we wouldn’t have an <code class="highlighter-rouge">is_alive?</code> boolean because we weren’t going to track
dead cells. Since our constraint for this round was “Tell, Don’t Ask”, our design shifted into
something that resembled the Command pattern.</p>

<p>Vamshi also showed me some neat conventions that he uses for RSpec. I found the pairing to be
really beneficial, for me at least, because I was able to learn some practical tricks from my 
partner that I can immediately apply to my day job.</p>

<p>It was definitely my favorite pair and I was bummed at how fast the 45 minutes went by.</p>

<p>#Pair Six
For this pair, we went back to our original partners from the morning session (Jon in my case)
and all constraints were removed.</p>

<p>Jon and I were both a little tired of writing the Cell and Board logic, so we decided to explore
an area that neither of us had gotten to work on yet - a graphical representation of the board.</p>

<p>We tried out “Ping Pong Pairing with Loopholes” - basically you try to screw over your teammate
by making the tests pass, but leaving the code still technically wrong - with the goal being to 
help you write tests that are more bullet-proof.</p>

<p>#Closing Circle
After six rounds of pairing, we regrouped and talked about the day for a bit. After going around
the circle, I traded business cards with a few people and headed home after a long (but fun!)
day.</p>

<p>A big thanks to <a href="http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/">Aaron Lerch</a> for facilitating, <a href="http://www.inin.com/">Interactive Intelligence</a> for hosting 
the event, and everyone there for making the event a huge success!</p>
