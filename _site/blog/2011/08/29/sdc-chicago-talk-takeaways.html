    SDC Chicago Talk Takeaways

  <div id="post"><p>This past weekend I headed up north for <a href="http://2011.socialdevcampchicago.com/">SocialDevCamp Chicago 2011</a>.</p>

<p>Though I spent most of the time coding a <a href="https://github.com/swanson/cloutbout">project</a> for the hackathon (and won a prize 
for the second straight year!), I was able to make it to a few of the talks at the 
actual conference.</p>

<p>I was unimpressed with the talks at last year’s SDC Chicago, but I was pleasantly
surprised with the speakers this time around. So here are my notes:</p>

<p>##Design for Hackers - David Kadavy</p>

<p>I had previously run across <a href="http://www.kadavy.net/">David Kadavy</a> through a series of blog posts he did that
were popular on HackerNews. The topic of this talk was “Whitespace” and some of the key
points were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whitespace shapes design even though it is often thought of as “nothingness”</li>
  <li><a href="http://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/gestaltprinciples/gestaltprinc.htm">Gestalt Theory</a> explains how our brains perceive and group visual elements</li>
  <li>Similar objects have a sense of “togetherness”</li>
  <li>The principle of Proximity explains how objects that are close together seem connected</li>
  <li>Closure is how our brains “auto-connect the dots”</li>
  <li>Use consistent and purposeful line-heights and leading to improve the flow of a page</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Tufte’s</a> 1+1=3 concept - two lines with whitespace between is really three items</li>
</ul>

<p>I was familiar with most of the material in this talk, but I felt like it was a good
introduction to design. I am still on the fence about whether or not I want to pick
up David’s <a href="http://www.designforhackers.com/">upcoming book</a>.</p>

<p>##API Driven Development - Craig Ulliott
<a href="http://craigulliott.com/">Craig</a> talked about building <a href="http://www.whereivebeen.com/">WhereIveBeen’s</a> data/API abstraction layer, the mistakes he
made, and how to design a better, more scalable solution. I liked this talk because Craig
was opinionated and spoke about his thoughts - I feel like this allowed him to talk about
specific ways to improve your API design instead of trying to please everyone with
general advice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Craig suggested that start-ups build an API with Rails because of its RESTful nature
and code readability</li>
  <li>You can always do a rewrite if you need to, you will probably have much more resources if you
reach a point where you can’t scale Rails</li>
  <li>Keeping a standard data model allows new services to be quickly integrated</li>
  <li>For mobile use, allow a “fields” option to minimize response size (aim for one network packet!)</li>
  <li>It is faster to cache a query that shows too much data and filter down fields in a different 
layer of the stack than hit the database again</li>
</ul>

<p>##Heedful Programming - Dave Hoover
I was really looking forward to this talk after reading <a href="/writeup/2010/10/26/apprenticeship-patterns.html"><em>Apprenticeship Patterns</em></a>, which
<a href="http://redsquirrel.com/dave/">Dave</a> co-authored, and it was really, really good.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dave talked about his background in psychology and studies by <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2393372">Karl Weick</a> about the
crews on aircraft carriers</li>
  <li><em>Heedful interrelating</em> is the idea of making knowledge connections between team members
to better handle complex problems</li>
  <li>Siloing really breaks down when a project needs multiple experts to collaborate on a
solution</li>
  <li>Is your team habitual or heedful? Which code fits your process: <code class="highlighter-rouge">next_week = clone(last_week)</code> 
or <code class="highlighter-rouge">next_week = retrospect(last_week)</code>?</li>
  <li>Bring in new blood that will question the process, “elders” should welcome new ideas</li>
  <li>If something in your process is painful, do it <strong>more</strong> - it will force you to get better at it, 
improve the process, or show you it is not needed</li>
  <li>Have a safe environment for developers to practice speaking or sharing ideas, encourage
involvement with the dev community</li>
  <li>Use process as a tool to build trust, then use that trust to remove barriers in the process</li>
</ul>

<p>So many points resonated with me that I am going to “fork” Dave’s talk and present
it at a brownbag at SEP. It really made me think about how to improve my team’s own process
and made me want to bring more aspects of Obtiva’s apprentice system to SEP.</p>
