<h3 id="why-devops">Why DevOps?</h3>

<p>Software Development and Deployment are two different but major tasks which involve huge efforts from developers and IT Operation team.</p>

<p>Every time a new build needs to be released code reviews and quality assurance need to happen. Also, Operation team needs to Deploy it in the production environment. Thus this process takes a lot of time until the Pipeline is completed and repeated on every new build.  So, DevOps generally include automated software integration, testing, deployments and infrastructure change management.</p>

<p>It’s the main objective to build an environment where building, testing and releasing of the software can be done rapidly.</p>

<h3 id="ci-cd-pipeline">CI-CD Pipeline</h3>

<p>Now DevOps introduced a new methodology to increase cohesion and to reduce coupling (Best Practices in Software Development). A new term to improve the Development and Development Pipeline, CI/CD Application does that for your company. Continuous Integration majorly focuses on the build system. CI can build from Various Version Control System(VCS) like Github, Tortoise SVN and much more. Continuous Deployment takes care of Pre-Production or Stagging Server. You can execute scripts, run unit tests, resolve dependencies, tools, and libraries.</p>

<h3 id="configuration-management">Configuration Management</h3>

<p>The configuration management process identifies and tracks the individual CIs, their physical attributes and functional capabilities, and their interdependencies as related to the services they support throughout their operational life. Such information typically includes the versions and updates that have been applied to installed software packages, and the locations and network addresses of hardware devices. A technician can use a configuration management tool to review the entire collection of related systems, verifying the effect or effects of a change to one system on other systems.</p>

<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Puppet, Chef, Ansible</p>

<h3 id="continous-monitoring">Continous Monitoring</h3>

<p>Quality is the main principle any service should be based on. Software development gains more and more popularity among services nowadays and quality of the product is usually the main point which guarantees the success of the project. A big number of developers can work on the project simultaneously and quality controlling and monitoring becomes a bigger challenge. One such challenge is to provide a comprehensive and brief visualisation of the progress of software development and the progress of quality assurance.
Continuous monitoring means that the specific software monitors work of the server in order to identify weaknesses, slow or failing components of the server, and informs a system administrator about any issue. A great server monitoring provides a detailed information on the health of the server as well as performance benchmarking, alerting capabilities, detailed reporting, data visualisation. Such statistic ensures smooth work of the server and respectively a flawless performance of the whole applications.</p>
