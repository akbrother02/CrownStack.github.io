<p>Project Scaffolding provides you an ecosystem for Small to Large Teams working on a project. Here at CrownStack, we help you kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to stay productive. To Generate an ecosystem that puts Developers, System Administrator, and Functional teams in a roof, This Blog will tell you how to scaffold your whole project with few command execution. We know the importance of Scalability, High Availability, Resilient, Optimization factors.</p>

<h3 id="step-involved-in-project-scaffolding">Step Involved in Project Scaffolding</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>First step</strong> towards project scaffolding is to setup Development, Staging(Testing or Pre-Production), Production Server. The best analogy to setup these server using Configuration Management Tool (Puppet, Chef, Salt, Ansible).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Second step</strong> is to set up a Version Control System(VCS) like Github, Bitbucket, Tortoise svn. Create a repository and then create branches for production(Master Branch) and Development(develop Branch). From develop branch create sub-branches for developers to add new features and core libs. When a feature branch is merged in develop; the CI/CD Server will generate a build and will Run test cases, Linters and Coding Standard Sniffer. To validate, verify and deploy the project to the development server and when it is verified that the build is stable, we will move it to Staging sever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Third Step</strong> is to integrate a Service and Webhook with CI/CD Server. Go to Settings of our Github repository and integrate a service, Jenkins. And Create a Webhook with <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://IP:PORT/github-webhook</code>. This will trigger build on push or pooling on develop branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Fourth Step</strong> involves the Directory structure of your project.</p>

    <p><img src="http://www.imageno.com/thumbs/20170622/mb1o7h3m4bhz.jpg" alt="file System" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fifth Step needs to test your code and its standard. Also write unit test case relevant to your Programming Language. Postman Testcases(Collection URL), Report of project deployment and third-party libraries used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Final Step</strong> is to create a workbook for your project. Which means you need to cover every aspect of your project workflow and life cycle. A project workbook is a set of rule about how collaboration will unfold, how coding standard will be maintained and various other aspect of software development which are relevant to current project.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="server-setup-and-configuration">Server Setup and Configuration</h3>

<p>You need to setup Development, Staging, Production server. These servers have different roles in software development.
Provisioning server on the cloud is effective as you can scale up and down depends on the resource usage. There are various companies providing reliable web services like AWS(Amazon Web Services), GCP(Google Compute Engine), Windows Azure. You can provision server manually as well as automatically using SDK(Software Development Kit).</p>

<p>Install Puppet to install and configure tools required to run your project. We have Puppet Master which will install packages as requested. We have grouped the packages. Find the suitable script and install it.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>yum install puppet (For RHEL &amp; CentOS)
or
apt-get install puppet (For Ubuntu and Debian)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, you need to execute puppet for installing packages from Puppet master.</p>

<h3 id="docker-for-containerization">Docker for Containerization</h3>

<p>Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) are some of the most common, but impactful use cases for teams who are looking to Dockerize their environment. The key to CI/CD is being able to automate the workflow, while still keeping the necessary features in place (like performing tests and leveraging staging environments) to assure the quality of your applications.

<h3 id="dependency-resolution-with-composer">Dependency Resolution with Composer</h3>

<p>Managing your dependencies manually in any programming language is a huge pain. This is why in most programming languages today you will find that they all have some implementation of a dependency management system or sometimes a package manager. The composer is the dependency management system that you will find on most modern PHP projects.
The composer is not a package manager. It deals with packages but in a “per project” way. While it provides a global installation option, it does not install anything globally by default.
Essentially, Composer allows you to declare and manage every dependency of your PHP projects.</p>

<h3 id="setup-version-control-system">Setup Version Control System</h3>

<p>Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.</p>

<h3 id="cicd-pipeline-with-jenkins">CICD Pipeline with Jenkins</h3>

<p>Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software. Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with the Java Runtime Environment installed.</p>

<h3 id="complete-documentation-and-test-report">Complete Documentation and Test Report</h3>

<p>You need to follow OpenAPI specification while writing Docs in your Code. Documentation will be created from your code. And Then you can use any tool like Swagger, Postman and Other to give a View to your API Specification.
Write Unit test cases for your feature branch. Each developer is responsible for its test case. Also, you need to commit your code with a relevant message. From your commits changelog will be generated.</p>

<p>You Need Not to install swagger and configure it. Put in the directory and do all those extra stuff. You need to specify it in Puppet script. And Puppet will take care of install and configure those setups.</p>
