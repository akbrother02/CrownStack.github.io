  <div id="post"><p>A quick update on some small wins and things I’ve learned while building <a href="/morale/">MoraleApp</a> – a no-hassle, team mood tracker.</p>

<h1 id="printer-friendly-styles">Printer friendly styles</h1>
<p>Around 10 different customers <a href="http://mdswanson.com/blog/2016/04/19/getting-reacquainted-with-customers.html">that took my survey</a> mentioned wanting to print out reports from the app to put up on the wall or bring to a team meeting. Totally reasonable and the app looked terrible when printed (due to a configuration issue that caused the main CSS file to not load when printing).</p>

<p>Styling an app to be printer-friendly is straight-forward, you just need <code class="highlighter-rouge">media=print</code> in the link (or use <code class="highlighter-rouge">@media printer</code> media queries). The hardest thing is just remembering to do it! A few notes/findings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CSS <code class="highlighter-rouge">box-shadow</code>s don’t work well, so I turned those off when printing</li>
  <li>Make sure to remove any unnecessary color to save people ink (i.e. switch gray text to black)</li>
  <li>Remove navbar/footers/extra application chrome that isn’t needed</li>
  <li>The page that people wanted to print had several charts and I didn’t want the printer to do a page break in the middle of them. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">page-break-inside</code> CSS rule helps the browser know where to put page-breaks, but it’s not an exact science</li>
  <li>Some browsers default to a setting that disables background images/colors (to save ink). This was a problem since each mood result for a team uses a background image (green, yellow, or red face). I might need to switch those icons to be actual <code class="highlighter-rouge">img</code> tags, but in the short term, there is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">-webkit-print-color-adjust</code> rule that can be set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">exact</code> to include images by default</li>
  <li>Make sure to test printing in both portrait and landscape – the original responsive design!</li>
  <li>Chrome allows you to fake out the media queries so you can iterate on the design of your print styles quickly; be sure to check the print preview in all the common browsers</li>
  <li>Actually print out the reports to check font sizes/margins. It’s a bit tedious but the only way to know for sure!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="getting-the-app-to-a-clean-slate">Getting the app to a clean slate</h1>
<p>As I <a href="http://mdswanson.com/blog/2016/04/22/compounding-technical-debt.html">mentioned before</a>, I was dealing with a pile of tech debt from out-dated libraries. I was uncomfortable building many large features before upgrading. And I was worried about upgrading because the app had no tests! A bit of a catch-22 :(</p>

<p>So I leaned into the pain and did the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setup a test suite (following must of the recommendations in the <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications">thoughtbot testing guide</a>)</li>
  <li>Wrote high-level, happy path tests with RSpec/Capybara – these are a bit slow, but I wanted full-stack tests that hit the database, router, and rendered real views. Isolated unit tests are great, but they wouldn’t help me figure out breaking issues as I upgraded library versions</li>
  <li>Pared down the Gemfile – I tried to remove gems that I didn’t really need; less gems =&gt; less surface-area for breakage when I bump the Rails version. I removed <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv_builder</code> (was generating one CSV file…), <code class="highlighter-rouge">bloggy</code> (moved the blog to GitHub Pages and out of the main Rails codebase), <code class="highlighter-rouge">xray-rails</code> (a cool thing that I used for about 10 minutes several years ago), <code class="highlighter-rouge">watu_table_build</code> (why was I using a weird fork of a weird gem to build tables? who knows!) and a couple other miscellaneous dependencies</li>
  <li>Upgraded Rails from 3.2 to 4.0 – luckily, Rails has nice <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html">migration guides</a> so I wasn’t completely lost. I fixed the broken stuff until the tests were passing</li>
  <li>Upgraded Ruby from 2.1 to 2.3 – this one should have been painless, but something got screwed up when I installed via <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby-build</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">rbenv</code> and I ended up with a corrupted <code class="highlighter-rouge">CSV</code> module. I have no idea what happened or how, but re-installing ruby was the cure (after several hours of head-scratching)</li>
  <li>Upgraded Rails from 4.0 to 4.1 – the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time…actually, just don’t eat elephants…</li>
  <li>Upgraded Rails from 4.1 to 4.2 – more fixes per the migration guides and suddenly everything was green!</li>
</ul>

<p>It took the better part of a week, but the terrible upgrade that I dreaded was over…and it wasn’t so bad.</p>

<h1 id="enterprise-sales-engineer">Enterprise Sales Engineer</h1>
<p>I reached out to a large user and asked about getting them onto an Enterprise plan. I haven’t built out the payment code yet, so I figured large customers that probably want an invoice might be good customers to start with.</p>

<p>A few emails later, I was on the phone with a procurement person and feeling like an impostor. But I kept my cool and, to my delight, the cost was peanuts to this large company and everything went great. Still waiting to finalize all the details, but I made a sale! For a huge plan!</p>

<p>I was dreading doing a sales call so I reframed the call as one afternoon of potential annoyance that would get me one month of runway ($$). Obviously not every call will end with a large sale, but this mentally appealed to me as I work toward a goal of generating enough revenue for this product so that it can “pay” one more person to work on it (instead of client work).</p>

<hr />

<p>I was a bit down in my check-in meeting because I felt like I wasn’t getting much done the past month. But looking back, there were many small wins and sharing them helped me realize that.</p>

<p>I still struggle a bit with direction: there is so much I could be doing, but nothing urgent that is pulling me. Hopefully, getting the app cleaned up will make it easier to tackle larger efforts that have a clearer focus. Next on the list: building out paid plans and payment infrastructure.</p>
