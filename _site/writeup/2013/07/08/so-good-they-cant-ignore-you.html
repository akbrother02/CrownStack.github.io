          So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love

    <p><strong>What’s the point?</strong><br />
“Follow your passion” is actually not good advice if you are seeking happiness
with your job. Passion is rare, dangerous, and oftentimes only comes with mastery.</p>

<p>A better approach is to focus on improving your skills, gaining more control, and
finding a mission.</p>

<p><strong>How was it?</strong><br />
This is my favorite book of the year by far.</p>

<p>Newport takes a very academic approach by making a hypothesis and then providing
evidence to support his views. He argues that “passion mindset” — in which
you focus on what value your job is offering to you — leads to unhappiness
and constantly hoping for a magically new job just around the corner that will fix
everything.</p>

<p>Instead, Newport argues we should adopt a “craftsman mindset” and focus on the
value you can offer to the world through your job. By increasing your skill level
in areas that are “rare and valuable” you gain career capital that you can leverage
to create work that you love.</p>

<p>By not focusing on getting a great job, but instead looking at the <em>traits</em> of 
great jobs, we can think about them in terms of basic supply and demand. To get
a great job, you must have something of great value to offer. And deliberate 
practice and a focus on being “so good they can’t ignore you” is a highly effective
strategy for acquiring valuable skills. You can then use those skills to increase
aspects of a job that are scientifically-proven to make you happier, like control, 
autonomy, and expertise.</p>

<p>The book also makes a strong argument against the “courage culture” of today’s 
resources for landing a dream job. If you have not built up the skills to succeed
in a new field, passion and the courage to quit your job are not going to magically
make you successful or fulfilled.</p>

<p><strong>Who should read it?</strong><br />
If you’ve ever daydreamed about how much better your life would be if you were
only working at that cool company, you should seriously read this book.</p>
