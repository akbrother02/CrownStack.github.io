          The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything...Fast!

    <p><strong>What’s the point?</strong><br />
You aren’t going to become an expert at most things in only 20 hours, but that’s
okay. There is a minimum level of competency that you can achieve that turns a
hobby into something enjoyable.</p>

<p>This book includes a list of tips for rapid skill acquisition and a collection
of diary-style chapters about how the author used the tips to learn things like
web development, playing go, and yoga.</p>

<p><strong>How was it?</strong><br />
It was a fun read. The framework is laid out in the first few chapters; steps
include choosing a project you enjoy, acquiring necessary tools, and defining a 
clear target level of performance.</p>

<p>The book goes a bit astray when it switches to examples. The concept of using the
author’s own experience picking up new skills is interesting — but I was left
wanting more insight. When Kaufman mentioned researching the best materials 
for each skill, I wanted to know more about his process for finding the 
books: what did he search for, how did he find helpful experts, etc.</p>

<p>The examples focused too much on just recounting what the author did; this was
frustrating since the majority of the book was devoted to these recaps.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the first two sections about tips for rapid skill acquisition
and improving your learning ability are worthwhile. I would recommend reading
those and then maybe one of the examples that most interests you (and skipping
the rest).</p>

<p><strong>Who should read it?</strong><br />
If you are looking to become competent in a new skill, I think the book is worth
a ready; just don’t hope for a magic solution to that will help you master anything
without putting in long hours.</p>
