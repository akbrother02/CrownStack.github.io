Material design as the Google guidelines is not just the design for a particular plateform, It is a visual language
which can be used on every plateform whether it is `Smartphone, tablets, PCs, TVs` etc.
Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadow provide meaning about what you can touch.
`Google states that their new design language is based on paper and link`.
It introduced in API Level 21(Android 5.0) and newer. You can use it to update your
`Support Library and Support Repository`.
