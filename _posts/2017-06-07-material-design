Material design as the Google guidelines is not just the design for a particular plateform, It is a visual language
which can be used on every plateform whether it is `Smartphone, tablets, PCs, TVs` etc.
Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadow provide meaning about what you can touch.
`Google states that their new design language is based on paper and link`.
It introduced in API Level 21(Android 5.0) and newer. You can use it to update your
`Support Library and Support Repository`.


### Responsive


Material is `full of energy`, it quickly responds to user input precisely where the user triggers it.
Ink ripples confirm user input by immediately expanding outward from the point of touch.


### Natural


Material depicts natural movement inspired by forces in the `real world`.
In the real world an element's ability to speed up or slow down quickly is effected by weight and surface
friction. In a similar way, `starts and stops` do not occur instantaneously in Material design.


### Aware


Material is aware of its surroundings, including the user and other material around it.
It can be attracted to elements and respond appropriately to user intent.
elements may attract other elements and join with them as they approach one another.


### Intentional


Material in motion guides focus to the right spot at right time.
Animation can bring focus to elements that need user attention.
