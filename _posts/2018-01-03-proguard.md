### ProGuard

ProGuard is free Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier. It detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes and renames the remaining classes, fields, and methods using short meaningless names. 

`Shrinking` – detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes.

`Optimization` – analyzes and optimizes the bytecode of the methods.

`Obfuscation` – renames the remaining classes, fields, and methods using short meaningless names

##### ProGuard output these files with each build:

`Dump.txt` : show structure of all class files in apk.

`Seeds.txt` : contains classes and members that were not obfuscated. e.g.
```sh
com.test.activities.TestActivity: android.widget.TextView textView (it will not obfuscated)
```

`Mapping.txt` : contains mapping between the original and obfuscated class, method, and field names. e.g.
```sh
com.test.activities.TestActivity$1 -> com.test.activities.TestActivity$1:
   com.test.activities.TestActivity this$0 -> a
   void <init>(com.test.activities.TestActivity) -> <init>
   void onConfirm() -> a
   ```

`Usage.txt` : contains code that was removed from the APK. e.g.
```sh
com.test.models.adduser.AddUser:
   22:22:public java.lang.String getName()
   ```

### Why ProGuard?

Android Applications are quite easy to reverse engineering, so you should use Proguard for Obfuscation, Shrinking and Optimization to prevent from reverse engineering. Shrinking eliminates unused codes, and it is highly useful. Optimization operates with java bytecode.

- Shrink your code 
- Reduces the apk size 
- Removes unused code and obfuscates the classes, fields, and methods with short names.
- Makes challenging to reverse engineer.
- Avoid reach 64k reference limit faster.

*example of obfuscates method :*

```sh
private com.test.f.t.c m6742n() {
        com.test.f.t.c cVar = new com.test.f.t.c();
        cVar.a(this.f4821m.a());
        return cVar;
    }
```
### How to use?
- To enable code shrinking with ProGuard write following in app gradle.
```sh
buildTypes {
   release {
       minifyEnabled true
       proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(‘proguard-android.txt’)
   }
}
```
- to keep class which you don't want to remove and obfuscates then use
```sh
-keep public class MyClass
```
- For each third party library you can write proguard rules in proguard file.

>Note
>>
>Avoid using ProGuard in debug build, because it increase the build time when shrinking code.

##### Some of the proguard rules you can in your proguard file

_(proguard-rules.pro) this would be your file name if using another for product flavours._
```sh
-dontwarn retrofit2.**
-keep class retrofit2.** { *; }
-keepattributes Signature
-keepattributes Exceptions

-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
   @retrofit2.http.* <methods>;
}
-dontwarn okio.**
-dontwarn com.squareup.okhttp.**
-keep class okhttp3.** { *; }
-keep interface okhttp3.** { *; }
-dontwarn okhttp3.*
-dontwarn javax.annotation.Nullable
-assumenosideeffects
class android.util.Log {
public static *** d(...);
public static *** i(...);
public static *** v(...);
}
```
