Programming is an art in which a person gets better with time and experience. A developer who is just starting his career has lot of things to learn and the first step is writing a well structured, consistent and beautiful code which follow basic principles like `DRY` and `Boy Scout rule`.

### Well Structured code

Well structured code improves quality, clarity and reduces development time. Dividing code base into Model-View-Controller (if you are using MVC), grouping classes based on their functions (for example, putting network layer/databases classes in one package), writing similar functions together in class, keeping their order according to their workflow and keeping them small, each performing one single task; these are the things a developer need to keep in mind while structuring a code base.


### Consistency

Consistent code always makes legacy code easy to work with which in turns reduces development cost and makes it easy to find bugs.
Consistency can be achieved by adopting lets say, a common code style guide, consistent naming convention and following industry standards.

Naming is one the hardest problem in computer science and it takes years to master this craft. A function's name should explain its intent or class name should reveal its use.
