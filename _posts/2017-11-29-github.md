**GitHub** is a code hosting platform of distributed version control system. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. With it you can restore old versions of your project, compare, analyze, merge changes and many more.

###### Installation of Git for mac-
Run the below command.
```
$ brew install git
```

###### Configure  your Git username and email using the following commands
```
$ git config --global user.name "Satish Phogat"
$ git config --global user.email "satish.phogat@crownstack.com"
```


###### Create git repository :-
Open github on web with url “https://github.com/” . Press + button on upper right corner and click on “create repository”.Give name to repository and select public or private and finally press “create repository ” button as given in below screenshot.
A Git repository contains the history of a collection of files.

###### Initialize Git -
Open the terminal and move to project where you want to install git. Then type the below command
```
$ git init
```

###### Create new branch -
It will move to master branch by default. We will create  and switch to new branch using below commands.
$ git create-branch <branch-name>


###### Naming of branches -
We provide Naming using by three ways.
If we are going to add feature then:
```
$ git create-branch feature/<feature-name>
```
If we are going to fix bugs then:
```
$ git create-branch bugs/<bugs-name>
```
If we are going to refactor code:
```
$ git create-branch refactor/<controller-name>
```

We do some changes to project. If we check project in remote repository then these changes are not updated on remote .
Run below command to check status
$ git status

first we have to convert these unstated file to staged file . add the selected changes to the staging area (also known as index) via the git add command.This will stage all files.
```
$ git add .
```

Run below command to add specific file
```
$ git add <filename>
```

commit the staged changes via the git commit command
```
$ git commit -m “feature: <controller-name>: "type message here"”
```

We can add file and commit by single command
```
$ git commit -am “feature: <controller-name>: "type message here"”
```


Attaching project to remote repository -
In Terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
```
$ git remote add origin remote repository URL
```

Push the changes in your local repository to remote repository of GitHub.
```
$ git push -u origin <branch-name>
```
###### Git setup -
This single command will set up a git repository (if one doesn't exist), add all files, and make an initial commit. dir defaults to the current working directory.
```
$ git setup
```

###### Delete branch
```
$ git branch -d <branch-name>
```
###### delete unmerged branch
```
$ git branch -D <branch-name>
$ git delete-branch integration
```

###### git delete-merged-branches
```
$ git delete-merged-branches
```

###### Merge branch -
First we have to check out to the branch which we want to merge with the branch <branch-name>.
```
$ git merge <branch-name>
```

###### Git rename-branch -
Rename a branch locally, and sync to remote via git push:
```
$ git rename-branch new-name old-name
```
###### Rename current branch:
```
$ git rename-branch new-name
```

###### Git back -
Removes the latest commits, and add their changes to your staging area.
Removes the latest commit using
```
$ git back
$ git undo
```
Remove the latest 3 commits using
```
$ git back 3
$ git undo 3
```

###### git clear -
Does a hard reset and deletes all untracked files from the working directory.

###### Git stash -
Git's Stash is meant as a temporary storage. When you're ready to continue where you left off, you can restore the saved state easily. There are lots of situations where a clean working is required: when merging branches, when pulling from a remote, or simply when checking out a different branch.

 Copy unstaged files to remote:
```
$ git scp staging
```
Copy staged and unstaged files to remote:
```
$ git scp staging HEAD
```

The "git stash" command can help you to (temporarily but safely) store your uncommitted local changes - and leave you with a clean working copy.
```
$ git stash
```

###### Generate pull request -
click on new pull request then create pull request to generate pull request.

###### Pull request -
Pull request is used to cloning the project from specific branch.We will get exact copy of code from that branch.
```
$ git pull origin <branch-name>
```
Git pull-request -
Create pull request via commandline.
```
$ git pull-request
```

###### git sync -
Sync local branch with its remote branch
```
$ git sync
```
Sync local branch with origin/master
```
$ git sync origin master
```

###### List of files -
ls command gives the list of all files in particular folder.
```
$ ls
```

Checking difference between commits -
Every commit has it's unique id in the form of a string of numbers and symbols. To see a list of all commits and their ids we can use git log:
```
$ git log
```

To see the difference between any two commits we can use git diff with the [commit-from]..[commit-to] syntax:
$ git diff 09bd8cc..ba25c0ff

###### git alias -
Define a new alias:
```
$ git alias last "here type name whose alias you want"
```

###### Show all aliases -
```
$ git alias
```

###### git info -
Show information about the repo:
```
$ git info
```

###### git effort -
Displays just the number of commits per file and  total number of days which contributed modifications to this file.
```
$ git effort --above 5
```

###### git commits-since -
This gives information about commit since given time
```
$ git commits-since yesterday
```

###### git count -
It gives total number of commit counts.
```
$ git count
```

###### Show merged branches -
Show all branches merged in to current HEAD:
```
$ git show-merged-branches
```

###### Show unmerged branches -
Show all branches not merged in to current HEAD:
```
$ git show-merged-branches
```

###### Git lock -
Lock a local file filename:
```
$ git lock <filename>
```

###### Git locked
List local locked files:
```
$ git locked
```

###### Git unlock -
Unlock a local file filename
```
$ git unlock <filename>
```
