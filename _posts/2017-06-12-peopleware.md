* A study of failed projects revealed that there was not a single technological issue explaining the failure. All the reasons came out to be of sociological order.

* Developers generally think they are in Hi-Tech business and in most of the cases it is not true. People who are inventing new technology are in Hi-Tech business. Developers are generally implementing their work. There is a serious need to understand this difference.

* Thinking about the work you are doing is one of the most important parts of software development. Spend time reading books, taking a day off to examine and think about your project are essential routines. Although statistics about reading are particularly discouraging. The average software developer has not read a single book about his work and profession.

* The hidden cost of unpaid overtime. Some managers think that working overtime is a matter of pride and somehow denotes how productive their team is or how much dedication they have. This is a very narrow point of view and does more harm than good because in the long term people get tired of this and some even pay a heavy cost in their personal life. In the end employee just quits and in general case, no one is measuring the reason/cost/effect of turnover caused by unpaid overtime.

* There is a general misconception that when teams strive for the quality they take longer time but in fact, quality has a positive effect on productivity. Think about the cost of maintaining a poorly designed system and calculate the cost and compare it to cost of maintaining a well designed, well-documented system.

> Quality is free but only for those who are willing to pay for it.

* Parkinson's Law, which states that work expands to fill the time allocated for it, is very well known among the managers but it is kind of misleading and does more harm than good to software development practice.
The data shows that when developers create their own deadlines they become more productive because they feel morally responsible for finishing what they have promised and that too, without someone needing to tell them to finish their work.

* Every human being has his/her own personality and therefore trying to create one unique framework for everyone to follow is a stupid mistake.

* Software development is one of that profession in which mind needs to work harder than muscle. Therefore investing in quiet, disturbance-free environment is one of the best investment companies can make.

* In general, the best developers outperform the worst by 10:1.  While the best developers are about 2.5 times better than a median performer. Also, top-performers' space is generally found to be quieter, more private, better protected from interruptions.

* When people start to complain that they can not do work in regular 9 to 5 hours, there is something needs to be done about the work environment.
