* A study of failed projects revealed that there was not a single technological issue explaining the failure. All the reasons came out to be of sociological order.

* Developers generally think they are in Hi-Tech business and in most of the cases it is not true. People who are inventing new technology are in Hi-Tech business. Developers are generally implementing their work. There is a serious need to understand this difference.

* Thinking about the work you are doing is one of the most important parts of software development. Spend time reading books, taking a day off to examine and think about your project are essential routines. Although statistics about reading are particularly discouraging. The average software developer has not read a single book about his work and profession.

* The hidden cost of unpaid overtime. Some managers think that working overtime is a matter of pride and somehow denotes how productive their team is or how much dedication they have. This is a very narrow point of view and does more harm than good because in the long term people get tired of this and some even pay a heavy cost in their personal life. In the end employee just quits and in general case, no one is measuring the reason/cost/effect of turnover caused by unpaid overtime.

* There is a general misconception that when teams strive for the quality they take longer time but in fact, quality has a positive effect on productivity. Think about the cost of maintaining a poorly designed system and calculate the cost and compare it to cost of maintaining a well designed, well-documented system.

> Quality is free but only for those who are willing to pay for it.
