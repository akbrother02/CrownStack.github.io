## Data Analysis
Although some researchers suggest that disassembling, coding, and then sorting and sifting through your data, is the primary path to analyzing data/data analysis. But as other rightly caution intensive data coding, disassembly, sorting, and sifting, is neither the only way to analyze your data nor is it necessarily the most appropriate strategy. It has been argued that they also fit the notice, collect, and think process invariably also belonging to the data analysis process.

### In the thinking process the researcher examines the things that have been collected. The goals of the data analysis are:

* To make some type of sense out of each data collection
* To look for patterns and relationships both within a collection, and also across collections, and
* To make general discoveries about the phenomena you are researching.

### Structured Data
structured data refers to information with a high degree of organization, such that inclusion in a relational database is seamless and readily searchable by simple, straightforward search engine algorithms or other search operations.
Structured data has a high level of the organization making it predictable, easy to organize and very easily searchable using basic algorithms. The information is rigidly arranged. Data is entered in specific fields containing textual or numeric data. These fields often have their maximum or expected size defined. In addition to the firm structure for information, structured data has very set rules concerning how to access it.
*Examples* of structured data include relational databases and other transactional data like sales records, as well as Excel files that contain customer address lists. This type of data is generally stored in tables. You end up with various columns and rows of data. One column might be customer names, and other rows would contain further attributes such as address, zip code, phone, email, credit card number, etc.

### Semi-structured Data
Semi-structured data as a type of data that contains semantic tags, but does not conform to the structure associated with typical relational databases. While semi-structured entities belong in the same class, they may have different attributes. Examples include email, XML, and other markup languages. The extreme simplicity of HTML and the universality of HTTP decreased the cost of authoring and exchanging information. We were suddenly exposed to a huge volume of information; this kind of information was, of course, not new, but the volume was unlike anything is seen before. 

### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data, on the other hand, is not organized in any discernable manner and has no associated data model. Some refer to data lakes as being the place where unstructured data is stored. This type of information is usually text-heavy and often includes multiple types of data. Examples of types of files generally considered to be unstructured data are: books, some health records, satellite images, Adobe PDF files, a warranty request created by a customer service representative, notes in a web form, objects from presentations, blogs, text messages, word documents, videos, photos and other images. These files are not organized other than being placed into a file system, object store or another repository.

### Where does Semi-Structured Data Fit In?

Semi-structured data falls in the middle of structured and unstructured data. It contains certain aspects that are structured and others that are not. For example, X-rays and other large images consist largely of unstructured data – in this case, a great many pixels. It is impossible to search and query these X-rays in the same way that a large relational database can be searched, queried and analyzed. After all, all you are searching against are pixels within an image. Fortunately, there is a way around this. Although the files themselves may consist of no more than pixels, words or objects, most files include a small section known as metadata.  This opens the door to being able to analyze unstructured.

### Data Visualization

Data visualization is a general term that describes an effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. Patterns, trends, and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization software.

### Importance of Data Visualization

Data visualization has become the de facto standard for modern business intelligence (BI). The success of the two leading vendors in the BI space, Tableau, and Qlik -- both of which heavily emphasize visualization -- has moved other vendors toward a more visual approach in their software. Virtually all BI software has strong data visualization functionality.

Data visualization tools have been important in democratizing data and analytics and making data-driven insights available to workers throughout an organization. They are typically easier to operate than traditional statistical analysis software or earlier versions of BI software. This has led to a rise in lines of business implementing data visualization tools on their own, without support from IT.

### Data Science vs. Big Data vs. Data Analytics

*Data Science*

What is a data scientist? What do data scientists do? Data scientists combine statistics, mathematics, programming, problem-solving, capturing data in ingenious ways, the ability to look at things differently to find patterns, along with the activities of cleansing, preparing, and aligning the data.

Dealing with unstructured and structured data, Data Science is a field that encompasses anything related to data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. Put simply, Data Science is an umbrella term for techniques used when trying to extract insights and information from data.

*Big Data*

What is a big data analyst? According to Gartner, the definition of Big Data reads, “Big data is high-volume and high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision-making, and process automation.” Big Data analytics find insights that help organizations make better business decisions.

A buzzword that is used to describe immense volumes of data, both unstructured and structured, Big Data inundates organizations of all sizes on a day-to-day basis. In other words, Big Data refers to humongous volumes of data that cannot be effectively processed with traditional applications. The processing of Big Data begins with the raw data that isn’t aggregated or organized—and is most often impossible to store in the memory of a single 

*Data Analytics*

What is the role of a data analyst? Data Analytics is the science of examining raw data with the purpose of finding patterns and drawing conclusions about that information by applying an algorithmic or mechanical process to derive insights. According to Forbes, the big data analytics market will surpass $200 billion soon.

The work of a data analyst lies in inference, which is the process of deriving conclusions that are solely based on what the researcher already knows; for example, running through a number of data sets to look for meaningful correlations between each other. Data Analytics is used in a number of industries to enable organizations to make better decisions as well as verify and disprove existing theories or models.
