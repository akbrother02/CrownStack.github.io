`fastlane` is a tool for developers that can do following tedious tasks with simple commands.

1. Generating screenshots.
2. Dealing with provisioning profiles.
3. Releasing application.

### `fastlane` Tools:

* `deliver`: Upload screenshots, metadata, and your app to the App Store
* `snapshot`: Automate taking localized screenshots of your iOS and tvOS apps on every device
* `frameit`: Quickly put your screenshots into the right device frames
* `pem`: Automatically generate and renew your push notification profiles
* `sigh`: Because you would rather spend your time building stuff than fighting provisioning
* `produce`: Create new iOS apps on iTunes Connect and Dev Portal using the command line
* `cert`: Automatically create and maintain iOS code signing certificates
* `spaceship`: Ruby library to access the Apple Dev Center and iTunes Connect
* `pilot`: The best way to manage your TestFlight testers and builds from your terminal
* `boarding`: The easiest way to invite your TestFlight beta testers
* `gym`: Building your iOS apps has never been easier
* `match`: Easily sync your certificates and profiles across your team using Git
* `scan`: The easiest way to run tests for your iOS and Mac apps


### Setting up Fastlane

#### 1. Install `Fastlane`:
Open terminal and run this command:

 `brew cask install fastlane`

### 2. Add `Fastlane` to project:
Navigate your terminal to your project's directory and run this command:

 `fastlane init`

`fastlane init` will prompt you for various information like Your Apple ID (e.g. fastlane@krausefx.com), asking if you want to use certain tools, and storing the information you input into files. It will create a directory called 'fastlane' in your root directory and a file named `Appfile`. 

The `Appfile` contains information that is universal to all the things you want to do with `Fastlane`. For instance, you would probably specify your `apple_id` and `app_identifier/bundle_id` in it like so:

```
fastlane/Appfile

apple_id 'abc@abc.com'
app_identifier 'com.abc.MyBundleID'

```
