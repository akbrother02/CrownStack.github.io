Every employee is CrownStack is given (or he/she chooses) a topic related to his/her area of interest. The topic can be a blog, book, tech podcast, new tools or something which helps them grow in their career.

## Responibilites

At CrownStack we pay special attention to continuous learning and improvements and it is a responsibility of everyone at Crownstack to become better and learn something new every single day.
